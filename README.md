# Logistic-Regression-Classifier
Created a regression model that predicts the travel time of a taxi ride in New York.

What I Learned from this project:
 - The data science lifecycle: data selection and cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model selection.
 - Using sklearn to process data and fit linear regression models.
 - Embedding linear regression as a component in a more complex model.
